"""
A convience API for handle common interactions with the Program model.

This is simply a set of functions that can be used elsewhere to abstract some
of the complexities in certain aspects of the codebase, but also to remove the
need to import the Program model elsewhere.

    `get_program_by_program_code` will retreive a specific program object
        based on the `program_code`
    
    `enroll_student_in_program` will enroll the provided `student` into the
        provided `program` (both the `program` and `student` are instances).
        Returns a True or False status to notify if the enrollment was
        successful
    
    `get_enrolled_students` returns the number of students enrolled in a given
        program
    
    `is_enrolled_in_program` will check to see if a student is enrolled in a
        given program
    
    `number_of_enrolled_students` will return the number of students enrolled
        in a given program
    
    `number_of_students_logged_into_access_program` will provide the total
        number of students in a program that have logged into the LMS
    
    `get_courses_locators_for_program` will return a list of the course
        locators containing the locator for module contained within that
        program

    `get_all_programs` will return a Queryset containing every program object
        stored in the `ci_program` model
    
    `student_has_logged_in` will check to see if a specific student has logged
        in
